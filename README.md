# Pixel-Website
The Personal Website of Pixel8edstudios. 

This is supposed to be more of a template for a one-page introduction website, to look good, or perhaps show off to your friends ;). Whatever the purpose, feel free to reuse and look upon this website as a learning tool if you are a beginner, as long as it falls under the current GNU Liscense. Thanks for reading, and hopefully you'll find this project useful in some way :).

Images: Please note that there are missing images. This is because it meaningless to add images that are personal, for me. If you want to, make sure to replace the images with your own.
