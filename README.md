# Pixel-Website
The Personal Website of Pixel8edstudios. 

This is supposed to be more of a template for a one-page introduction website, to look good, or perhaps show off to your friends ;). Whatever the purpose, feel free to reuse and look upon this website as a learning tool if you are a beginner, as long as it falls under the current GNU Liscense. Thanks for reading, and hopefully you'll find this project useful in some way :).
